    <h3>The best Meal</h3>
    <p>My mother often served a delicious Polish dish made with cabbage.</p> <p>We always topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and sometimes served this over mashed potatoes.</p> <p>You can make this just using the cabbage, but I add kielbasa or smoked turkey for additional flavour. Delicious. </p>
